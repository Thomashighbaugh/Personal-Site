# TODO Items

- [x] DONE Add environmental secret to Vercel for the Github API
- [x] DONE Fix project list height
  - issue caused by setting space-y > 0 for whatever reason expanded the height of the first list item only
- [x] DONE button outline for project action buttons
- [x] Fix Project Title Pill
  - Had className `index-title` thus was applying unnecessary and impossible to style for dark and light
    mode text shadow. Set to `project-title` solves issue
- [x] DONE Go back to `heropatterns` image
  - increased image size by 1.5x looks better behind blurred content tiles
  - cliche (now years after I start using it) but easier to work with and all around just a better tile-able svg pattern
- [ ] TODO Consistent Opacity + Blur
- [ ] TODO Get rid of WindiCSS or get rid of this incarnation and start fresh
