### A smooth GTK3 Theme With Dark Interfaces For Easy Viewing At Any Hour

## Perserving the Theme

The EvoPop theme is a Budgie DE designed alternative to the standard GTK3+ theme by the Gnome team. It is a gray theme with accents of a twitter-ish blue that is smooth and easy to look at. It is also, unfortunately, discontinued and though still available via repository that could easily change. Having a back up copy of the theme is one thing, however I always preferred it with a dark background and use a variety of DEs, most of which lack the dark mode toggle.

Thus I created a version of EvoPop that is dark for myself to use. I modified some of the windows that still appear light even with the toggle to make the theme even better for my purposes and host it for anyone else who finds themselves needing EvoPop and wanting the dark theme.

#### Using CSS for GTK3+

The technical aspect of this project, and any others featuring GTK themes, is that it utilizes CSS and therefore speaks to a set of skills I have developed for use on websites that is becoming increasingly useful in the context of the Linux desktop.
