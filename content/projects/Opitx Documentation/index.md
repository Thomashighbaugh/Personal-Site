# Opitx Documentation Site 
### The Stylish Alternative to Docs Site Boilerplate

## More Than Boilerplate
While many docs sites have troubles far more essential in dealing with than the appearance, like making coherent statements that indicate how to use the program, there is none the less a tendency for otherwise well designed and thorough programs to have docs sites that are merely boilerplate + cryptic text. Additionally, if an effort does not generate a web site like developing BASH scripts or Electron apps, as this is the docs site to, I normally host some front end splash page for the project as a means of sharpening my skills. However, this site is a particular point of pride for me due to the very appealing and easy to use interface that makes the information clear and easily accessible. 

### Branding 
Like the Opitx application, this site features all of my own branding that I came up with while developing the application and implemented personally. This branding is such that the site and application are consistent and coherent. This follow through in implementation of the design, as well as the particular functionality of the design, are why this page is being showcased at all. 

## To Do
