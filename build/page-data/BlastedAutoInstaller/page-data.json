While this has engendered in me the natural inclination to back everything up several times, and other great habits, it means reinstalling programs became a real nightmare. I could use Ansible, but my workstation isn’t something I am going to remotely provision from another PC, considering any such provisioning would be from that computer and spending money on a digital ocean ansible host is not possible at the moment, nor is running another PC simply for this purpose. Enter Blasted Auto Installer. </p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>The scripts contained in the git repo all provision specific things that I often use. Each of them perform a different task, ennumerated below, and can all be called individually or from a central script that asks the user if they want to install the script and takes the command from the keypress, no enter required (which is easier than Ansible for these purposes let’s be real)</p>\n<p>Scripts and description thereof </p>\n<ul>\n<li>black - installs the Black Arch Repo and All Programs (if you need them all)</li>\n<li>manjaro - central script that will call the others</li>\n<li>pacman - uses pacman package manager to install files (—noconfirm means no additional input should be needed unless I missed that flag on a package)</li>\n<li>gedit - provisions Gedit’s settings </li>\n<li>dots - calls in my dotfiles and installs them in the home directory</li>\n<li>github = packages pulled in from Github with automation of the next steps </li>\n<li>spacemacs - installs spacemacs over emacs and starts it for initial configuration</li>\n<li>install-snap - the reason I am using Manjaro over Arch </li>\n<li>nvm - for installing the node version manager </li>\n<li>yay - using YAY, available through the manjaro repos, this installs AUR packages </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>To Do</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> add zenity gui for manjaro</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> create templates script </li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> cleanup the repo</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> zsh/powerlevel10k script </li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> add script for installing EvoPopDark</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blasted-Auto-Installer","date":"August 05, 2019","description":"Scripts that I use to quickly provision my systems after fresh installs"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/BlastedAutoInstaller/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Colt45-GUI/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Colt-45-GUI"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Ansible-Manjaro/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Manjaro Workstation Ansible Playbook"}}}}}
