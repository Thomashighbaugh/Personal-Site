Additionally, if an effort does not generate a web site like developing BASH scripts or Electron apps, as this is the docs site to, I normally host some front end splash page for the project as a means of sharpening my skills. However, this site is a particular point of pride for me due to the very appealing and easy to use interface that makes the information clear and easily accessible. </p>\n<h4>Branding</h4>\n<p>Like the Opitx application, this site features all of my own branding that I came up with while developing the application and implemented personally. This branding is such that the site and application are consistent and coherent. This follow through in implementation of the design, as well as the particular functionality of the design, are why this page is being showcased at all. </p>\n<h2>To Do</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Keep Documentation Current With Changes to the Application</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Visit the Site</h2>\n<p>If you would like to explore the Opitx documentation site, follow <a href=\"https://opitx-docs.netlify.com\">this link</a></p>",
