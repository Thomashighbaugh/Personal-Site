Most options either save in some database format, which can lead to being left with a mess of backups with random strings as the file names. </p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>An Electron application that uses the system standard menu options, the power of React to create the interface and Prismjs for syntax highlightings and creating the live preview mode. </p>\n<h4>Packages Generated</h4>\n<p>To install and use Opitx, which I warn you is still a work in progress but does its primary objective possible, I have packaged it in RPM DEB and APPIMAGE formats. Download the one you want from the Github Repo and BAM!</p>\n<h2>To Do</h2>\n<p>The application is not getting the attention I would prefer due to my time being consumed elsewhere, however it is going to receive some major renovations soon. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Theme switcher allowing users to change primsjs theme on the editor tab</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Better ReadME</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Fixed Menu</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Open from last file used feature</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Keybindings </li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Refreshed visuals </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documentation Site &#x26;&#x26; Repository</h2>\n<p>To see the documentation for the program see:    <button className=\"nav-btn  ml-2\">\n<a href=\"https://opitx-docs.netlify.com\">\n[ opitx docs]\n</a>\n</button></p>\n<p> See the source code on   <button className=\"nav-btn   ml-2\">\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/Opitx\">\n[github]\n</a>\n</button></p>",
