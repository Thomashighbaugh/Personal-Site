summary: I am going to be pulling most of these older posts now located on this page and replacing them with a new approach, so get ready (and save anything you want )

I am planning to move towards content that is more code laden, because let's face it, there is plenty of volumes of random people's opinion on the internet but precious few resources for coding AwesomeWM configurations (among other things) that I will be trying to contribute to the learning of humanity on the subjects. The content that is already more like this will be spared, but the rest is going to be consigned to the git history of this repository.

The new format will be something of a mixture of the penultimate form of Linux dorkiness, literate programming, mixed with a healthy dose of me imitating in a mocking way the way Medium articles are written, complete with terrible memes. The topic I will be most fixated on will be the one which had me carve together 400+ files in a language I hate, AwesomeWM with its strange dialect of Lua it tortures its users with. So get ready!
