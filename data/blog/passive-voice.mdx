> Warning: This article is not so much about technical matters, nor was it written for ease of consumption. Instead it is a full account of my opinion that probably requires some amount of background in linguistics, history and the English language as it has evolved in the US and Britain.

In school, I was always more of an English-type and still hate the process of laying out mathematical formulas on paper with pencil `yuck!` In pen, I could always find some way around whatever temporary limitation my memory or lack of knowledge sprung in my path like a track star leaping over those horrorifyingly painful bars on the track. This led to a proper introduction to Victorian literature in an upper division English class in undergrad that rendered my already bombastic tendencies in prose to become... well you are looking right at it, so I think its pretty obvious.

My paternal grandmother, may she rest in peace, was an English teacher and through her very particular way, I developed a keen sense of how to string together some mighty long sentences without violating any of the `rules` of English if it can be said to have any (English lacks a central body standardizing it, unlike Spanish standardized by a Spanish university for example. Thus it is arguable that any rules actually exist when so long as two speakers or more agree on a convention or definition it could easily be considered valid within that context).

Despite my deliberately painful prose being correct (mostly, no one is perfect), anytime I install a browser extension or `vscode` extenison like `Grammarly` it goes nuts on my writing and frankly following its simplistic notions of what English should look like would stifle my unique voice that everyone so reviles because its not simplistic and sterilized of any flash of character. Though this alone might not be a reason to eschew these language linting applications, yet the frankly incorrect grammar rules they ever so often are rooted in might be.

To be fair, Grammarly does allow for passive voice in a narrow range of circumstances, but these are far too narrow to reflect the actual usage of passive voice in English, of either American or British variant (I am not totally aware of how this would play out in other dialects). My own writing, idiosyncratically taking from a mixture of Melville and the mostly British literature that's 200 years old I enjoy (American novels other than Moby Dick are just trash I hate to say) despite being an American, typically employs the passive voice in two contexts Grammarly isn't accounting for: 1. Being polite, as to use the passive voice often is more polite because you are not directly stating what some else is doing, which may just amount to asserting your misconception as truth. 2. I do not know the appropaite noun to use, as it may not be inherently obvious so Grammarly throwing an error when clearly it also doesn't know the noun is really irritating.

We should also consider what the effect of language linting applications will have on the language other than stripping out this hugely important grammatical form. The first thing that comes to mind is the loss of changing language patterns. The differences that exist within English across its many dialects are from varied patterns of its usage in geographically distant places that eventually become accepted by some community that asserts itself the source of `proper English` in an ever so dubious way. When you have some browser plugin screaming at you because it doesn't like your pattern of usage, you will be inclined to sterilize your writing of it or will probably see little benefit because your mind will begin ignoring the error signal indiscriminately (its really hard to keep what is to be ignored and not in mind without this happening) which will mean that in many cases the sheer number of examples of alternative usage patterns that are at the crux of the diverse multitude of dialects will be stripped away and thus the development of additional dialects will be hampered to some regard in the name of making your writing `easily understood`.

Now, I will admit there is a place for these sorts of applications if one is new to writing in English they will prove invaluable resources as it takes a certain level of fluency to reach the point any native speaker _should_ be at, where they would have command enough of the language to tend towards the sorts of fringes of the rules that language linting has no choice but to use. Those who simply didn't like English class are not a group that should even need to use such programs, many probably are already at the level sufficient to only be hampered by such tools and if not anyone able to teach themselves a programming language can most definitely use Khan Academy to get to that point. An easy way to determine this would be to take a practice fluency test for English at its highest tier
