summary: I am approaching the end of the most absurdly over the top project I could ever imagine spending so much time on, my AwesomeWM configuration. This is the teaser coming ahead of its release.

If you go on the subreddit `r/unixporn` and spend a little time looking around, it becomes clear that the most mature and capable of the tiling window managers commonly used in that community is the horridly named `Awesome Window Manager`, or `AwesomeWM` for short. By default, its an abysmal and hideous creature that in order to just remove its God awful default wallpaper you have to begin learning the most horrendous language I have worked with other than emacs-lisp. Yet some of the examples from the AwesomeWM subsect of that community are so incredibly featureful and visually interesting I was like a moth to the flame. 

A year and half after discovering the Window Manager and using it sporadically, with several flourishes into working on my configuration, I have reached the point where I have written something that integrates all the features I like from almost every configuration I could find, with plenty of my own innovations gluing it together and making the style of each file consistent and sensible, not things Lua is evidently prone. This article will address the flying spaghetti monster of code that my configuration has become and how I managed to make it fly despite its size. 

## 400 files? Why Not!

The whole project comes in at a little over 400 files. About half are files I am explicitly not managing that are dependencies I have learned to keep specific versions of, as submodules introduce instability and instability means seeing the default wallpaper, which I legitimately hate as mentioned. This kind of a code base is beyond obnoxious, yet it works rather well and with minimal system resources being absorbed in its operation.
