summary: Terminal text editing starts out as a nightmare when first using Linux, but its become the far better application for writing code for me, one that provides a level of ergonomics and effceincy unheard of in the traditional IDE space, it just takes a few plugins and a steep learning curve.

I started using Linux before the new, simplified, nano editor for terminal was mature enough to be commonly used. So I had no choice but to learn how to use the old default edits, vim. After a while, I became good enough with vim to accomplish basic editing tasks with it, which enabled the dotfiles process that has reached complexity levels approaching my creation of a whole Linux distro to steamline the process of installing my system and to give people a way to test it in the environment those dotfiles create as a unit.

However, it wasn't until discovering Spacemacs that I had any real desire to deepen my knowledge of, which I began as I began realizing the power offered by that program. Spacemacs became Doom Emacs, neither of which I liked much and found org-mode to be over rated the more I tried to use it. Then, one day not too long ago now, I found an interesting and logical way to organize a rather large vim configuration that made sense in its organizational structure and began the process of writing out my own huge configuration, which is something I am thankful to finall have found as its improved my life writing code imensely.

## Organization Patterns

A big part of my use of vim as an IDE lately was enabled by a repository I found which eschewed the typical set of nonsensically named files typical of a vim configuration, it instead used a directory called 'vimrc.d' to house the files configurating the whole Vim distribution, which are prepended by a number providing their order.

This `/etc` like style is actually much more reasonable to modify than most other options, it enables me to easily make and find modifications within the configuration at a faster clip than searching through directories with names like `ftplugin` and make sense of when they will be called when I am starting vim.

Emacs, of either variant I have used, lags at startup regardlless if stripped even of packages specific to that distribution, but vim has no such lag even with 52 plugins (at present). So the organizational pattern I have adapted clearly isn't holding it back. There is also tooling in the vimrc that enables one to use overrides in the startup process before and after the main `init` is run, thus mitigating any potential issue arising where something is needed at a specic time in boot up.

## Superior Notes

I have no issue with Emacs and I detest the `fanboy` tendencies many other Linux users have, I just use what works for me in my use cases at that time. What doesn't work well for me is trying to keep my notes in org-mode as the syntax is bulky and the macro within Emacs is fickle about much, so as I have mentioned in prior posts, I instead opt for vimwiki, which works perfectly for my purposes and I keep stored in my Dropbox and on Github without much fuss from the program itself while being truly able to
