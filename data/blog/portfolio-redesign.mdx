summary: For the last few months, I have really been working on polishing my online portfolio as web developer, during that time I discovered Tailwind.css, which I used first in to write my online resume, which I decided I wanted to use in a rewrite of this site and the site you are now on is the result.

## Motivations
Rewriting my portfolio site is a stressful endeavor for me, I can be a bit of a perfectionist, at least with myself and especially about my personal projects that reflect me as a developer. Thus I had grown very dissatisfied with the prior variant of this site, especially with the unmanageable SCSS nested stylesheet and also have really tired of the same sections in the same single page web apps that are most of the results of a Google search for `portfolio sites` regardless what language, framework or library. So in setting out to rewrite my portfolio site I sought to acheive:

- A stylish interface with a less problematic stylesheet, preferring atomic design patterns 
- To use neutral tones that naturally worked well with light or dark modes
- tasteful animations on some UI elements, nothing crazy or jarring 
- perfect lighthouse scores 
- a unique take on the standard sections of the developer portfolio site
- a chance to use my personal logo in the site (in lieu of a headshot) 
- a site that optimizes Server and Client side rendering to create a seamless experience 
- a gallery to feature some of my art in, preferrably more than just one piece

## Next.js: the Natural Choice
Frankly, I just don't like Vue as much as React. It is just more natural for me to write according to the paradigms presented typically in React development and so I wanted my site to reflect that. I have a lot of experience with Gatsby.js and Next.js (as discussed in another blog post even...) which has lead me to choosing Next.js over Gatsby.js sheerly due to Next being a more relisient wrapper around WebPack that has a lot of built in functionality that is painful to get working in Gatsby, like the extremely important rendering on the server and client I discussed above. 

On top of that, Next doesn't really get in your way the way Gatsby does, thus it breaks less. This unobstrusive nature has paid off in big ways in this project, which needed two blog rolls that are wildly different from each other (more on that below). Plus I have taken to using Vercel for a lot of my JAMstack hosting needs due to their ease of use and transparency in billing (for heavier, database dependent sites, I use Heroku).

## MVP: Tailwind
Tailwind.css, which I discovered while writing my resume after seeing another resume (which directly inspired my own) using it to make the process of making the document print friendly a much less painful process. So I implemented it in my own write up and was blown away by the possiblities it offers. Which I don't mean in the typical web developer hyperbole, I was actually excited enough that I used it in this most recent refresh of my portfolio site. 

What I like about Tailwind is it provides the seamless experience of Bootstrap but offers a depth of customization that doesn't interfer with its utility. You can configure it to do almost anything, which is a hard and unreliable process if done with Bootstrap (I have tried) and takes away from that experience, while modifying tailwind, even substantially, doesn't make for any additional headaches and you still get to reap the rewards of not having to cross check a stylesheet with the JSX/HTML and a live preview in the browser. 

### Get the Jit
Additionally, I used the Tailwind.css JIT, or Just-In-Time, compiler that made the process even more seamless, rendering my stylesheet as I wrote out my code (including the stripping out of the unneeded bits with purge.css, which makes tailwind so lightning fast).
