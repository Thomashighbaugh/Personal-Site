title: NeoVim or Why I Learned to Stop Hating Lua and Just Use It

summary: Lua is not my favorite language, but now I have another reason to use it and use it often, it can be used to configure the nightly version of NeoVim and makes for much better performance. This post is my coming to terms with Lua and acknowledging my experience with it.

Lua is not my favorite programming language, I find the way it is written and the conventions that are commonly used in its composition somewhat artifical and disjointed. On top of that, it is not used for a lot of programs that I find myself using either in the Linux or Web Development world. Nonetheless, in pursuit of the optimal desktop environment, I have dove deeply into its articulation and manipulation, a process that is still on going but close itself to completion at the time of writing.

As it turns out though, there is something that I use pretty often that _can_ use Lua and by switching to Lua one can realize some signficant improvements in performance, **VIM configuration**. Being ultimately intended for the configuration of other programs, as it is essentially a wrapper around some specific C functions, Lua bindings have been exposed in the nightly edition of NeoVim (you know the unnecessary seeming variant of VIM that is essentially just continuing VIM's development) and as it turns out using Lua is this context is more than just the painful mess that it is in AwesomeWM, it actually improves the speed and performance of configurations loaded with plugins to the point of actually being a reasonable replacement for an IDE in terms of adding in the functionality important to developers while not making for long load times. This alone makes me think maybe Lua isn't the height of annoying after all, in fact its use in non-AwesomeWM contexts makes it realize the claims of its speed and reliablity, indicating something about AwesomeWM's source code I will discuss in another blog post later.

There are several all Lua configurations that one can find on GitHub worth looking over before diving into using such a configuration, [my own](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/nvim) of course and [NvChad](https://github.com/siduck76/NvChad) are both highly functional and skip none of the necessary features of making NeoVim as much like VS Code(the other IDE I reluctantly use since Sublime is effectively abandoned) as possible. First though you need to make sure you have the right NeoVim installed, to do this enter the commands below into your terminal.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim

$ cd neovim

$ sudo make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release install

#Clean Up Time
$ cd ..

$ rm neovim

```

NeoVim also has dependencies that are dependent on the language you are seeking to use/write in, which you probably also want to get installed locally before running it for the first time.

```bash
# Python 3
 pip install neovim pynvim --user
 # Python 2
 pip2 install neovim pynvim --user
 # Ruby
gem install neovim
# Node.js
npm i -g neovim
## Or
yarn global add neovim
```

Now if you wanted to install my specific NeoVim configuration, this final set of steps and you are home free

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/nvim .config/nvim

 git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim

nvim -u "$HOME"/.config/nvim/init.lua +PackerInstall

```

Or you could install all these (and so much more) using the installation script associated with [my dotfiles](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/dotfiles)
