title: The Secret of VSCode's Success

summary: This article argues the success of VSCode of arguably better code editors tailored to specific languages is because of its large ecosystem of plugins, not due to anything about the underlying code or quality of the program.

VSCode has become the dominant code editor, replacing the more vibrant environment of when I started learning web development, with Sublime, Brackets and, for Windows users, NotePad++ that were once the primary code editors for almost all purposes. VSCode has even made headway into the sophisiticated audience that Intellj targets with its highly refined IDE's based on the JRE environment and featuring an arguably more better experience for most environments one can find a tailored form of their editor specified. Even I use VSCode for certain projects that require a lot of switching between files, some of which I could use WebStorm but because there is not a JetBrains product for Lua, I have found myself settling for the Microsoft product.

## But Let's Be Clear

Its not because VSCode is really that good, it runs on Electron and even with the purported magic of Typescript (which I am skeptical of) it still is bloated and prone to getting fickle with the wrong combination of plugins and, like Microsoft products tend in general, especially when it is most needed. Yet there is a reason that VSCode has taken all the market share of arguably better alternatives, like Sublime.

## Its All About the Multitude of Plugins Available

VSCode is so ubiquitos primary because it has a wide variety of community developed, questionable quality plugins available for it. This provides the appearance, and in some cases (such as lua) the reality of choice. No its not development servers, those can and are implemented in other IDEs pretty easily, I use them in NeoVim (and am also equally unconvinced of their utility as Typescript) and so if they alone were the thing driving the success of VSCode, it wouldn't make sense why a port had not just made them available on a better platform.

Its instead the appearance of all the community extensions as to making user feel like they have a lot of options, which they do. VSCode allows for plugins from other IDEs even, which makes its adoption smoother. It has options second only to vim in sheer quantity even if quality is usually pretty dubious. This same principle drives the success of many software products, especially Windows itself which is Microsoft's main bread winner despite itself and while finding the Microsoft hatred a distasteful, partisan relic of Linux past, it is something that Microsoft clearly has learned some lessons from and it seems has finally used it to capture the development community by storm.

## Having Options Doesn't Mean Having Good Options

While a lot of plugins are really high quality and useful, there are as numerous numbers of them that simply aren't. Vim suffers from a set of issues due to its large extension community, both also suffering performance hits if too many are installed on top of the dubious quality that some are.

Sometimes plugins are written with ineffcient code. Other times, they hardly serve their intended purpose correctly and due to the overwhelming number of options, you easily can find yourself in a position where keybindings cross and VSCode doesn't handle this so well, often opting to do neither option. Then if anything goes wrong, figuring out where that error is coming from with the browser like debugging tool can be a bit of a pain. Which I am very used to, it is much like AwesomeWM debugging which is a constant battle I am fighting, but for those not so versed in obscure Window Managers on Linux, this is a real frustrating process and easily will lead to those who know to do so deleting the configuration files with the extensions and restarting from scratch (or uninstalling and reinstalling if they know not to do so).

There are extensions allowing extension packaging and a virtual environment like experience to isolate types of development, but I often opt for just going back to NeoVim if something I am doing starts down that path before adding the additional complexity and management hassle. There are some awesome extensions syncing you preferences, mitigating that issue and making that more seamless at least, but packaging sets of applications for React, Javascript, Typescript, Lua, C, etc is just more of a pain and definitely doesn't sync with your settings (like your projects if you use a project manager extension be advised a reinstall means reselecting them all).

## Nonetheless Its A Nice Tool to Have

Overall, I like having the option of VSCode and the Xresources theme makes it blend right into my environment overall, which sublime never did. Since its used by most other developers, it is also good to stay up to date on its use, however I am comfortable with NeoVim for most of my needs, I like the options it provides and the super speedy performance gains it provides as a terminal based application without an instance of Electron running on it. Yet when I need it, or when I am irritated with NeoVim due to my configuration going bonkers on me due to something I messed up, I am glad to have it. Were the JRE less of a pain and JetBrains to offer more Lua support, I might prefer Webstorm again, but I can't justify the price in its present state (though prefer its curated plugins a lot) but as it stands I use VSCode for a similar reason to Github (also now a Microsoft product) which is I am not trying to be any more counter culture as a developer than Linux already makes me, I prefer using things that fit my needs and for now VSCode fits them best as my secondary IDE.
