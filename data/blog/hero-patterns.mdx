summary: A shout out to the single most generous gift any developer has ever given every other developer. HeroPatterns is a website that offers its visitors free use of dozens of svg images intended to be used as CSS backgrounds. Being that it is a resource I use with almost every site, often providing the x-factor that makes the interface look good to user, so I thought a thank you was in order and spread the word to other developers who might be interested in using this awesome, free resource themselves.

Sometimes, one comes across an open source technology that changes their lives in some meaningful, generally positive, way. Indeed my entire journey with development and Linux has been almost entirely one of such discoveries fueling my interest and staving off burn out and frustration, but there is one particular open source offering that stands above all the rest (other than Linux of course) that I wanted to write up a quick, open thank you letter to: _**HeroPatterns**_

> What is _**HeroPatterns**_?

[HeroPatterns](https://heropatterns.com) is a website where a developer from Canada has assembled some 80+ tileable `svg` images with a web interface that allows you to pick a pattern, an accent color and a background color then provides you with the code to copy-paste into your `css` stylesheet thus enabling a rather easy and seamless way to add more interesting backgrounds to your work.

### Its truly magical

These are not just some slidshod collection of scraps that are being offered at HeroPatterns, these are tasteful and clearly were something the author put a lot of time into. But unlike anything Adobe makes (or is made on their software), these aren't going to cost you 50 bucks a month. Not even the much lower price FontAwesome charges for their icons, nope these beautiful accent pieces are `free`
