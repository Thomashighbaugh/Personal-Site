# Tailwind Everywhere

Tailwind.css is a trendy new way of incorporating the consistency of a CSS framework like Bootstrap into a site. Unlike the traditional means, this framework is unique to your site and totally under your control. This provides fine grained control over the CSS of the site, while enabling most of the styling to be done in the JSX/HTML through classes that either conform to some rather sane defaults or can be tweaked in a Javascript configuration file called `tailwind.config.js`. 

You could write, debug and loose sleep over a typical, voluminous stylesheet broken into dozens of files. The problem is that introduces inconsistency that simply isn't possible with Tailwind, which dynamically generates the stylesheet based on the configuration file (and purges uncessary CSS in the process).
