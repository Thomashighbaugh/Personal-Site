title: The Electric Tantra Branding
date: "2020-07-15"
summary: I needed a resume, I use Linux, despise traditional Word Editors and thought I should put my HTML skills to work for something practical. So I rewrote my resume in it and used Tailwind.css for the first time.

## Context
I needed a resume, I use Linux, despise traditional Word Editors and thought to myself:

> Why did I learn to arrange documents in HTML and so precisely style them in CSS if I am not going to use it to style **this document**.

So I found [this project](https://github.com/WebPraktikos/universal-resume), which uses Tailwind, which I hadn't used before, but liked so much I thought I would take a crack at making it fit my particular needs and use case while exploring what Tailwind has to offer.

## The Result
[See it here](https://thomashighbaugh.github.io/resume) and check out the code [here](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/resume) which you can freely use as the basis for your own work.

Can't promise it will help you get a job, has definitely peaked interest in yours truly.

### Self Reflection on the Resulting Code
- I can definitely spend more time on a few points of annoyance and working out the kink in the printer variant
- heropatterns saved me once again, giving me the background that adds a 'New York high finance circa 1985' vibe to the site
   - check out the tailwind.css plugin `tailwind-heropatterns` for an easy method of including the patterns into your next project.
- really like the blue-grey compromise I've made for accent colors,
   - such that it has become the default palette for all my personal sites
      - it emerged from my vice color palette for base16 and a happy accident involving Themix GTK Theme Editor
- tailwind is a hit,
   - allowing for the consistency of bootstrap
      - but with the ability to do immense customization
      - and without the prefab components that are quickly outgrown.
   - I will need to work on taming the class monstrosity


## Coming Soon to Theaters Near You: Tailwind.css
This project, which happened entirely in December 2020, also was the start of my tryst with Tailwind.css, which I will explain in another, deliberately abbreviated post on it as it truly deserves its own paragraph worth of text (as is the typical `dev.to` article at its base).
