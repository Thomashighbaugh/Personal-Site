### Added

-

### Changed

- merged dependabot and other automated dependency pull requests that cleared all tests.

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Whiny eslint plugin offering little helpful and complaining a lot.

### Fixed

- fixed banner display issues
- my tailwind config vanished somehow (I blame me not being careful cutting not copying it for use elsewhere) which obviously spurned a host of issues that once restored, absolved themselves

### Security

## [0.0.1] - A While Ago

- This change log and the paradigm are themselves newer to my discipline as a developer than this site,
  - but I am not going to try to back date it or add in a bunch of semi-intelligable git commits as back filled changelog items.
  - Instead just recognize a lot has gone into this project prior to the beginning of this log but hence forth I am going to try to maintain this log to make continuing my work on this site a more informed and less spastic process.
