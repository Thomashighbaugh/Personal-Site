The design of all of my personal efforts and much of the artwork I produce is done in what I call the "_**Electric Tantra**_" style. This is my
personal take on the aesthetics called "_neon noir_" that comes from a specific variant of vaporwave and cyberpunk aesthetics that take from _film
noir_ a certain dark feeling and replace the grays with neon colors. Thus you have this website, which defaults to white to be in line with best
practices but which I almost exclusively look at and edit in the darker variant unless working on the appearance itself.

The _**Electric Tantra**_ is more than just the aesthetics of the interface's appearance, it is expressed in the UX considerations and the way that I write out the site's source code, then use prettier to make it less obnoxious to keep that source code clean and easily read. Ultimately, it informs all of what makes my personal efforts the things that they are.

## Definition

Like the Tantras of Dharmic faiths, this one is not easily expressed in a concise sentence so here is a list with the characteristics, roughly, of what I mean when I say the **Electric Tantra**

- Balanced Design - Not preferring too much or too little, nor gimmicky or flashy but also not bland and dull
- Clean Code - code that can be read easily by humans and machines alike.
- Flares of Color - while tending to whites and blacks for primary colors, it also features vibrant flashes of color.
- Easily Navigated - Obvious means of navigating the interface, instructions that are written out clearly.
- Achieves Goal - sites are meant to perform some function, thus this design paradigm emphasizes function over flashy.
- Not Another 'Not Another' - as is evident on this site, these sites eschew the standard templates for various sites and strip out unneeded features.
