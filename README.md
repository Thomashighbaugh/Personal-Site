Hello, my name is Thomas Leon Highbaugh (as I am sure you can tell) and this is my portfolio site. 

I wrote it in Next.js (React), Tailwind.css and it features a tasteful background by [HeroPatterns](https://heropatterns.com). 

Being a showcase of my work over all, which includes graphics design and digital art, all of the artwork on the side **except the background** are all my work (all rights reserved on that part, otherwise you are free to do whatever you want with the rest).
