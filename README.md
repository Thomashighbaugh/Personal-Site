# Portfolio Site

Thank you for visiting the repository that houses the source code for my portfolio site! This repository is what Vercel, my static website host, uses to build the site in production.

## Features

So what's different about this portfolio and the 9 million others that you have seen? Well quite a bit actually, starting with the structure of the site which is as follows:

- Home - a simple introduction landing page
- Projects - a curated list of projects I have completed, each on its own card and alternating in structure to give visual flare to the page
- Blog - my blog, because having it on another site doesn't make a ton of sense.
- Skills - my tech related skills, nicely packaged in a bootstrap accordion
