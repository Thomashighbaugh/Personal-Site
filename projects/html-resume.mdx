LaTex is an awesome tool and from my dabbling with to create the resume I had used prior it is something that if one gets used to the quirks of would probably be the best way to format academic papers and books that needed to be typeset. I just have a lot of other things occupying the queue before I will have time to learn those quirks but still needed to refresh my resume, yet I have been using Linux for years now and so the typical office software solution isn't available in its fully featured form and the templates it offers are not very good (let alone the absolutely awful open source office suite and what templates it has...). So I decided to test out Tailwind.css for the first time and write up a resume in HTML since I am fully proficient with it and it is a _document markup language_ after all.
