A lot of people post on Reddit without actually giving out any source code, which I often chalk up to the thing existing as a mockup and especially when it is named partially after a software suite intended to do exactly that. However, I noticed that it would be a rather simple project to put together using the power of Next.js and so I took an afternoon to offer the users of Reddit the source code they wanted, written my way and based entirely off of an image.
