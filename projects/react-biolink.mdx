description: A Linktree alternative that I wrote using the TnT(Typescript React, Next.js & Tailwind.css) combo that fits my personal style better than any third party options and saves me a whole lot of excess typing / tedious copy pasting.

While just as adverse to the unnecessary duplication of effort, I wanted and needed a good oppurtunity to work with the web development tools I know and love after deep dives into Lua with AwesomeWM and my NeoVim configuration and found that the `link-in-bio` options were lacking in the looks department and so I opted to write my own suited to my particular, idiosyncratic taste. As always, the tasteful background `SVG` is courtesy of the `HeroPatterns` project, awesome resource and really top notch patterns.
